# python

This is a personal project I created to assist a friend who keeps track from data he acquires from PDFs that he downloads every month from a specific website.

The proccess is simple, enter the website, look for the PDFs, download them, look for the data inside each PDF and insert it into a spreadsheet.

It took a little longer than I expected to build this because I found out that there is not much pattern to the way those PDFs are created...

The pages where the information is stored sometimes change and also the location from the information on that page.

But after some tests, the final product was able to succesfully deliver the solution for the required need.
